# Labelit

<img align="left" height="200" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mirobit/Labelit/master/frontend/assets/images/logo.svg">Labelit is a simple and straightforward tool for fast anonymization or pseudonymization and labeling of text data. This is particularly relevant if you're planning to work with text corpora (e.g. twitter posts) that contain a lot of personal references. Labelit allows you to remove personal information while maintaining the informational and semantical content. On top of that, with Labelit you can label text corpora with self-selected classes - a necessary preprocessing step for all kinds of quantitive analyses.  
Just create a project, import your data, create categories for named entities and start replacing sensitive information with your predefined words.

**Warning:** The software is still in early development and currently only works in a local environment. Do not use it on a remote server, there is no file upload yet. Also does not work in Safari and IE (no support planned).

## Features

- Create projects with custom categories, classifications and wordlists
- Import a CSV/JSON file or a folder with raw text files
- Texts and replaced words are stored AES-256 encrypted in the database
- Easy to use texteditor: single click selection, keyboard shortcuts and duplicate detection
- All texts can be checked against previously found sensitive words (project based wordlist)
- Lightweight single-page application (no heavy frontend framework -> 15 vs 85 mb, 200 vs 2500 dependencies)
